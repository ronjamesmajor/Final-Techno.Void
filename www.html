        <h4 style="font-family: MADSENSE;">The Evolution of the World Wide Web</h4>
        </p>
        <p>The World Wide Web is a term which is used to describe the information stored on the inter-connectivity of
            computers across the backbone of the internet.
            This is a differentiation from the internet itself in that the internet is in fact the interconnected
            network.
            The web however, as it is affectionately referred to, is the series of hosted sites, information, data, and
            in more recent years multimedia (and secret algorithms to steal all of your personal data) which are hosted
            on this network.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>Web 1.0: What is it?</h4>
        <p>

            Well back in the early days (the early nineties to the beginning of the 2000’s), people who used the
            internet and individuals who developed web pages did not fully realize the potential of the medium
            and they <em>certainly</em> did not call it ‘Web 1.0’. Early pages of course were text based, but it was not
            long
            before graphical web browsers such as Erwise, ViolaWWW and Mosaic were introduced.
            With Mosaic Web Browser, in the early days of Web 1.0, people could actually view graphical content like
            colors shapes and the occasional image.
        <p>
            Fast forward a few years, and this era was where we saw the first Browser War. Many programs were used to
            view the contents of the web at
            first, but, most notably, a browser called NetScape Navigator
            which
            saw an early rise to prominence, competed with Mosaic to become the dominant graphical web browser.
            Then, Microsoft released it's own version of a Web Browser called Internet Explorer.
            This sparked the first true competition to decide which technology was best suited to view the world wide
            web.
        <figure id="bwar" class="figure"><iframe width="560" height="315"
                src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W4wWdmfOibY"

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Browser Wars of the 90's and Early 00's</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Unfortunately, like most technology in the
        90’s
        and early 2000’s, Microsoft would not stop until it had fully realized it’s patented “Embrace,
        Extend, Extinguish”
        Mantra, and stomped out it’s competition in the web browser space.
        </p>
        <p>
            Common web technologies during this period were things like static web
            pages, pages separated by frames, and exciting background images. Popular “new” web technologies
            during
            this time included the browser compatibility showdown between</p>
        <p> Netscape's < blink> and IE's < marquee>.</p>
        <marquee>Of course Marquee eventually won out.</marquee>
        More common features which were very snazzy and cool before web developers became predatory
        psychopaths were things like guest-books and hit counters. This simpler time, is also when this
        author first
        learned HTML-3.0. <img class="rounded" style="filter: grayscale();" src="./assets/hitcounter.gif">

        <p>

        </p>
        <h4>Web 2: Electric Boogaloo</h4>
        <p>
            Officially, Web 2.0 started around 2004ish, but the term was coined in 1999 by Darcy DiNucci. The
            idea of Web 2.0 was the idea of a connected web in which individuals could assist in the
            contribution of content, and connect with one another together over the world wide web. Obvious
            prominent examples of this technology are websites like Twitter and Facebook. However the idea
            was really pioneered and cultivated by Wikipedia, “web television” sites like Revision3, and
            social bookmarking / news sites like
            <img style="display: inline-block; width: 8rem;" src="./assets/reddit.png" alt="reddit logo" />
            , and
            <img style="display: inline-block; width: 4rem;" src="./assets/digg.png" alt="digg logo" />

        </p>
        <p>
            As a personal aside, in fact,this author has very fond memories of digg.com in the early days, and even
            shared some drinks with the founder and host of

            Diggnation turned multi-millionaire angel investor Kevin Rose, as well as Diggnation co-host
            Alex Albrecht. Rose would later go on to found other Web 2.0 pioneering sites and technologies
            such as social network / micro-blog Pownce, Milk, and fasting app Zero.

        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>Common traits of Web 2.0
            sites were the ability to connect and interact with other individuals online, but it was also
            the beginning of “dynamic” and “responsive” web design, as well as Software as a Service, and
            extensive multimedia support for things like blogs, podcasts, and the framework for modern
            social media. In turn, YouTube was created and became a multi-billion dollar platform which
            houses lifetimes of “Content” for people to “consume”. This is also where the story begins to
            take a darker turn. The introduction of Web 2.0 meant that through constant connection,
            curation, and interaction, bad actors could come up with new and exciting ways to terrorize and
            manipulate others. Not just through person to person interaction but also via “interactive
            marketing”. Things started to take a turn toward data aggregation to build profiles of users
            likes and dislikes to serve ads better, and over time mutated into a Skinner Box of subtle
            behavioral manipulation via reward learning and social rewards to have the end user engage more
            frequently with the product (social media) and in turn, ad placement.
        </p>
        <p>


        <h4>Web 3.0: the future is now!</h4>
        <p>
            Web 3.0 is still a concept which is being fleshed out and is widely
            discussed across many different platforms. Finding information to write about it can often be
            difficult, because there are dissenting opinions on what web 3.0 is really, and while some
            consider it the future, others say we’ve been in 3.0 for a while now. There are certain
            structures which do seem to carry across many definitions though, and they’re just as sinister
            as you might expect. Web 3.0 can be often described as being the “semantic web” in which
            algorithms digest and re-distribute data to one another to create a Terminator 2-esque hivemind,
            often regerred to as either "Skynet" or “The Singularity”. In order to have functionality so grand,
            a second proposed property of Web 3.0 is required. </p>
        <p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Think of Semantic AI like an always learning Neural Net</figcaption>
        </figure>
        That being of advanced Artificial Intelligence which is capable of understanding and relating
        data in a meaningful way. <em>As an aside, this author recommends the written works and lectures
            of Jaron Lanier on this topic.</em> Web 3.0 will require ubiquity, and will by way of adoption be
        ubiquitous.
        Yet more, it will enable to capability of sharing more
        than just the most modern media we have but also 3d graphics and even games could be shared across websites.
        Much of this technology exists today with websites that can play 3d games right in HTML5, and
        certainly the internet of things encapsulates the idea of ubiquity across devices. With that
        stated, it’s easy to see how perhaps there are many of the proposed ideas of Web 3.0 already at
        play today in the modern world wide web.

        <h4>So what Technologies will be driving this push toward the future?</h4>
        <p>Well, in the opinion of this
            author:
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h5>Low-Code app creation:</h5> For those not in the know, Low-Code or No-Code app creation is a
                burgeoning Web 3.0 innovation which enables users of all levels to develop or assist in the
                development of applications for use at home, on mobile, or in the workplace. One such example of
                this is Microsoft Power Apps , where utilizing the Microsoft office ecosystem, users can build
                sets of functionality and macros to partially automate and expedite their daily work-flow. It
                also ensures that users without an abundance of IT skills can get jobs done without the
                extensive knowledge they might have required just a few years ago.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                <h5>Machine Learning:</h5> We’ve all heard of Machine Learning by now. Advanced algorithms which can
                dissect and decompose massive swaths of data and then analyze and sort the data. The algorithm
                then internalizes this data and can more expediently access “answers” based on this data in the
                future. It’s the belief of this author that machine learning will be a major driver in how
                business and big – tech interact and work with consumers and other businesses in the future-
                which will drive the web more in the direction of being a tool used by companies to flip the
                traditional role of “user” and “content” where the content becomes the user, and the user
                becomes the content.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                <h5>Data Dignity:</h5> Finally, a lesser spoken about concept which may be the hope that people are so
                desperately looking for across the degenerate landscape of the modern world wide web. The data
                dignity concept is most spoken about by computer scientist, Microsoft researcher, and the father
                of virtual reality Jaron Lanier. The idea is that a users data has value, and so too does a
                users contribution to the world wide web as a user contributed medium. A dream of a world where,
                by decentralized controlling third parties called “Mids” (short for intermediaries),
                contributors and consumers alike can either be paid in small micro-payments for their data when
                it is used, or pay a small micro-payment to utilize data or services. Users could also choose to
